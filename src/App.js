            You have probably noticed by now. You have probably heard it too - the drums rolling in
            the background every time the group and WoL put their heads together to devise a new
            brilliant plan that will save yet another day. <br></br>The dread you feel the moment
            you hear it. <br></br>
            You might ask: "Oh, Soken! Why!? Why do you torment us with this track? Why does it play
            every second cutscene? Tell us, why must we suffer?" <br></br>The answer will not come.
            <br></br>
            You carry on with the Main Scenario quest, hopefull that you will hear new sounds, new
            music that will elevate your experience, that will make you <em>feel something</em> and
            make the story a bit more engaging. Yet, you hear it again. The drums. The dread. The A
            Realm Reborn soundtrack that played over 10 times already... <br></br>
            ... Did it? You're unsure. So you go back an start counting your suffering.

            I got fed up with hearing ARR music in Dawntrail, so after suffering with my friend,
            I've decided to make this counter so we know <em>exactly</em> how many times we were
            forced to hear this uninspired piece over and over during MSQ. There are over 733
            soundtracks in the game. Do better, SE. <br></br>Enjoy counting!
