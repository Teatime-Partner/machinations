# FFXIV Machinations Counter

Going through the MSQ left me feeling dreadful after hearing Machinations, a very old ARR soundtrack, almost every other cutscene. Considering Dawntrail is full of cutscenes, big and small, the impact it has left on my experience is massive. I wanted to hear more new tracks, and instead I got a throwback to ten years ago and not in a great way.  
This project is just a simple counter with multiple states to count my and yours miserable experience as you traverse through Tural and wish you've heard something more than "We are coming with a great plan!" music on repeat.

## About the project

Single and static web app created using CRA template, implementing Bootstrap and SCSS for responsive design.  
Uses local Storage and use State to preserve the counter between multiple sessions and page refresh.
